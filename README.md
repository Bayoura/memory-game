# PokéMemory

![Screenshot](/src/img/memory-game-screenshot.png)

In this game, you get a selection of 20 Pokémon (randomly chosen from the first 151 Pokémon). The goal is to click each Pokémon once, and only once. After each click, the Pokémon cards get shuffled around. On the top, you can see your current score, as well as your high score.

This project was built using React functional components and the PokéAPI.
